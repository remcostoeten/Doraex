# Doraex
Aka Dora the explorer.

This repository provides a interface for viewing and managing local SQLite or cloud-hosted PostgreSQL databases. It is primarily built for personal use and as part of my journey transitioning from a front-endâ€“only developer to a full-stack developer, while exploring new technologies.

Normally I exclusivly write NextJS + server functions + Drizzle via PostgreSQL or SQLite. This project is split in two parts:
- Frontend: Svelte
- Backend: Bun + Hono
